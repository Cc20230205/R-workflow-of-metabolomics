#Understanding of data#
First of all, we have to know that raw data of MS/MS anlaysis can not be analyzed by R directly.
Usually, when you open the raw data, you can find profile MS data, like total ion chromatogram (TIC). But the profile MS data can not be recognized by R.
In fact, R can recognize centriod MS data, so raw data must be converted into centriod data prior to do anlayze with R.
Generally, centriod MS data is a three-dimensional bar diagram, like a bar diagram with X, Y, Z axis. 
X axis indicates retention time (rt), 
Y axis indicates mass to charge (mz),
Z axis indicates intensity.
Ideally, different MS1 has different rt, so we could separate each MS1 by comparing their rt.

#Conversion of data format#
Different machine leads to different data format. Please check it before starting your conversion of data format.
Taking Q Exactive Orbitrap Mass Spectrometers (MS) as an example. Mscovert is used to transform raw data into mzML data format by adding peak picking option.
Mscovert could be downloaded in ProteoWizard (https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/)
